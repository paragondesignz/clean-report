# Database Schema Fix Instructions

## Problem Summary

The browser console errors you encountered are database schema relationship issues that need to be resolved in your Supabase database. These errors are preventing the proper operation of the customer portal and hours allocation features.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Missing Foreign Key Relationship
**Error**: `Could not find a relationship between 'job_worker_assignments' and 'sub_contractors' in the schema cache`

**Problem**: The `job_worker_assignments` table was created with a TEXT field `worker_id` instead of a proper UUID foreign key relationship to the `sub_contractors` table.

### 2. Timestamp Validation Errors
**Error**: `invalid input syntax for type timestamp with time zone: ""`

**Problem**: Some timestamp fields in `user_profiles` and other tables don't allow NULL values properly, causing validation errors when empty strings are passed.

### 3. HTTP 406 Not Acceptable Errors
**Error**: 406 errors on user_profiles table operations

**Problem**: Row Level Security policies and/or schema mismatches causing access issues.

## Solution

I've created a comprehensive SQL fix in `fix-database-schema.sql` that addresses all these issues.

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Run the Schema Fix in Supabase

1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to the **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the contents of `fix-database-schema.sql`
4. Click **Run** to execute the SQL

**Important**: This SQL script is designed to be safe and will:
- Drop and recreate only the problematic `job_worker_assignments` table
- Preserve all existing data in other tables
- Add proper foreign key constraints
- Fix timestamp validation issues
- Update RLS policies for security

### Step 2: Verify the Fix

After running the SQL, check that:

1. **Relationship is established**: 
   ```sql
   -- Run this query to verify the foreign key exists
   SELECT 
       tc.constraint_name, 
       tc.table_name, 
       kcu.column_name, 
       ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
       ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name 
   FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc 
   JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
     ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
     AND tc.table_schema = kcu.table_schema
   JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
     ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
     AND ccu.table_schema = tc.table_schema
   WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY' 
     AND tc.table_name = 'job_worker_assignments'
     AND ccu.table_name = 'sub_contractors';
   ```

2. **Tables exist with correct schema**:
   ```sql
   -- Verify table structures
   SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable 
   FROM information_schema.columns 
   WHERE table_name = 'job_worker_assignments';
   
   SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable 
   FROM information_schema.columns 
   WHERE table_name = 'sub_contractors';
   ```

### Step 3: Test the Application

1. **Test Customer Portal**: 
   - Visit `/customer-portal/login`
   - Log in with existing credentials
   - Check that the dashboard loads without console errors

2. **Test Hours Allocation**:
   - Create or edit a job
   - Assign workers and hours
   - Verify time tracking functionality works

3. **Test Report Viewing**:
   - Access the Reports tab in customer portal
   - Verify reports load correctly

## What the Fix Does

### Database Schema Updates

1. **Creates proper sub_contractors table** with correct UUID primary key
2. **Recreates job_worker_assignments table** with:
   - Proper foreign key to `sub_contractors(id)`
   - UUID `sub_contractor_id` instead of TEXT `worker_id`
   - Constraint to ensure valid worker assignments
   - All existing functionality preserved

3. **Fixes timestamp issues** by:
   - Allowing NULL values where appropriate
   - Setting proper DEFAULT values
   - Fixing validation constraints

4. **Updates RLS policies** for:
   - Proper security isolation
   - Sub-contractor access controls
   - Customer portal user permissions

### Preserves Existing Features

- ✅ All customer portal functionality
- ✅ Hours allocation and time tracking  
- ✅ Report generation and viewing
- ✅ Existing job and client data
- ✅ Authentication and security

## Expected Results After Fix

After applying this fix, you should see:

- ✅ **No more console errors** about missing relationships
- ✅ **No more timestamp validation errors**
- ✅ **Customer portal loads properly** without 406 errors
- ✅ **Time tracking works correctly** with sub-contractor assignments
- ✅ **Report viewing functions** without issues

## Backup Recommendation

Before applying the fix, consider creating a backup of your database:

1. In Supabase Dashboard, go to **Settings > Database**
2. Click **Create backup** (if available in your plan)
3. Or export your data using the **SQL Editor**:
   ```sql
   -- Backup critical data (run these before the fix)
   SELECT * FROM jobs;
   SELECT * FROM clients; 
   SELECT * FROM job_worker_assignments; -- This will be recreated
   SELECT * FROM user_profiles;
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check Supabase logs** for detailed error messages
2. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
3. **Clear browser cache** and retry
4. **Check RLS policies** are active in Supabase dashboard

## Support
